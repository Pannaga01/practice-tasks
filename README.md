## login-page
I did the login-page using:
- login.html- A html page which has the basic structure of the page and takes the username and password from the user.
- login.css- This gave the basic styling(eg:adjusting it to centre)
- login.js- Evaluation of emailid nd password and reirection to new page is done here.
- successful.html- Redirected page

## Error page:
I used a html page which had the basic content. I used css for background, bootstrap for home button. 

## Jekyll blog:
I searched for the theme chosen in my github account and forked it. 
I changed the branch from master to gh-pages.
I did the changes required in the page according to my interest.
