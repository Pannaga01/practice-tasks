## login-page
I did the login-page using:
- login.html- A html page which has the basic structure of the page and takes the username and password from the user.
- login.css- This gave the basic styling(eg:adjusting it to centre)
- login.js- Evaluation of emailid nd password and reirection to new page is done here.
- successful.html- Redirected page

## Error page:
I used a html page which had the basic content. I used css for background, bootstrap for home button.
